        <h3>What is this?</h3>
        <p>
          <a href="https://github.com/pmret/papermario">papermario</a> is an ongoing
          project to reverse-engineer the source code for <a
            href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_Mario_(video_game)"
            >Paper Mario</a
          > on the Nintendo 64. The game's assembly code is manually decompiled into
          C source code. The project also extracts game assets (such as backgrounds,
          sprites, maps, and text) from an original game copy into more modern formats.
          The C code and assets can then be <i>recompiled</i> to create a 1-to-1
          ("matching") copy of the game.
        </p>

        <h3>Why?</h3>
        <p>
          Different contributors have their own reasons for decompiling Paper
          Mario. These include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Preserving the game</li>
          <li>Learning more about how the game was engineered</li>
          <li>
            Helping speedrunners and glitch-hunters understand why bugs occur
          </li>
          <li>Making engine mods easier to create</li>
          <li>Enjoying decompilation in and of itself</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>How completed is it?</h3>
        <p>
          We've reached 100% with the US version of the game. We are currently
          working on full support for the remaining versions of the game, asset
          support, and more.

        <h3>You've reached 100%! Congratulations!</h3>
        <p>
          It's been an incredible journey so far. Although our progress graph
          shows 100%, this is only one way of measuring the progress of the
          project. We still have more work planned to make the project the best
          that it can be.
        </p>

        <h3 id="aspects">What other areas of the project still need work?</h3>
        <p>
          Although we have reached 100% on the US version, there are still many
          areas of the project that need work. These include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Assets: Although many assets are properly handled and are moddable,
            there are still a few assets that are not properly being extracted
            and rebuilt in a way that would allow for porting or modding
            efforts.
          </li>
          <li>
            Codebase modernization: We plan to add QOL features to the codebase
            so the code is as nice as it can be while still compiling to match
            the original assembly.
          </li>
          <li>
            Documentation: Many variables, functions, enum values, and more are
            not yet named or documented.
          </li>
          <li>
            Other versions: The remaining versions of the game have not yet been
            fully matched, and we plan to support all releases of the game.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="prose-col">
        <h3>PC Port?</h3>
        <p>
          There is still work to be done before work can be started on a PC
          port. The primary blocker is that some assets are still packaged as
          raw binary data, rather than being properly extracted and rebuilt. Now
          that we have reached 100% for the US version of the game, we will be
          focusing on support for the remaining assets.
        </p>

        <h3>Can I make mods with this?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes. However, we're still working out issues with modding support, so
          please bear with us. Although the main repo is suitable for modding,
          Alex has started a fork of the main decomp repo, <a
            href="https://github.com/nanaian/papermario-dx">papermario-dx</a
          >, which aims to provide a more convenient base for creating mods.
        </p>

        <h3>How can I help contribute?</h3>
        <p>
          There plenty of ways to get involved, not limited to helping with
          asset support, documentation, and code cleanup. Please feel free to
          get involved!
